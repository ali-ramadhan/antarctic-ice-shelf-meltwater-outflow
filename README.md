# antarctic-ice-shelf-meltwater-outflow
Idealized modeling of the ocean dynamics of meltwater outflow from beneath Antarctic ice shelves inspired by 2D simulation by [Naveira Garabato et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature20825).

Reference temperature and salinity profiles correspond to the left hand side profile of figure 3 in Naveira Garabato et al. (2017). They were collected roughly ~5 km from the calving front.
